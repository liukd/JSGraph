					<h1>Working with Templates</h1>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						Templates are predefined <code>AttributeList</code>s including the members of the <code>AttributeList</code> and values that are assigned to the members or <code>Attribute</code>s. Templates
						are assigned to an <code>AttributeList</code> to bind the <code>AttributeList</code> to a centralized and predefined set of settings for the <code>Attribute</code>s. You can 
						assign a template to muliple instance of an <code>AttributeList</code>. The <code>Attribute</code>s within the <code>AttributeList</code> fetch their values from the Template as long
						as the value of the <code>Attribute</code> is not explicitly set. Once the <code>Attribute</code> receives a specific value this attribute does not retrieve its value from the
						template any more. But the other members of the <code>AttributeList</code> stay connected to the template as long as their values are not set. Whenever the template changes,
						the <code>Attribute</code>s that are not explicitly set, retrieve the new values from the template.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You can use template e.g. to define styles for your <code>GraphItem</code>s. This could imply format or font settings, but this can also be used to set predefined settings for
					    custom <code>AttributeList</code>s. There are two advantages to this approach. The first advantage is that you can centralize settings, that can easily be changed afterwards. Those
					    changes are then reflected in all instances of the <code>Attribute</code>s (unless they were overwritten). The other advantage lies in the fact, that it saves memory, as the <code>Attribute</code>   
					    only needs to allocate memory, if it has a specific setting.  
					</p>
					<h2>Using a Template</h2>
					<p>
                        Let us look at a few examples to clarify the idea of templates. First we will create a template for formats derived from the default format template. This template
                        is changed setting a different format and assigned to three of the four items. The first item is still bound to the default template and does not reflect any change, when
                        the template is assigned or changed. The second and third are bound to the template and change with the template. The fourth has its own instance of the FillColor
                        attribute and does not change this attribute, when the templates changes, but the other two. 
                    </p>
					<div class="codediv">
					<pre class="prettyprint" source="useTemplate"></pre>
					</div>
					<button type="button" onclick="sampleCode.useTemplate()">
						Create and assign Template
					</button>
                    <p>
                        Now we only change the template and the change will be reflected in those items, that are attached to the template. Note that the first item still remains unchanged.
                    </p>
                    <div class="codediv">
                    <pre class="prettyprint" source="changeTemplate"></pre>
                    </div>
                    <button type="button" onclick="sampleCode.changeTemplate()">
                        Change Template
                    </button>
                    <h2>Creating a Template</h2>
                    <p>
                        The next step is to create a template for a custom attribute list. In the following sample the custom attribute list from the previous samples is used. The list is created
                        and in addition a template is created derived from that list. This template is set as a parent list for the custom attribute list. This step actually sets the template as
                        the active template for the custom attribute list. The attribute values are then retrieved from the template as long as the attributes of the items attribute list
                        are not changed directly. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="codediv">
                    <pre class="prettyprint" source="createTemplate"></pre>
                    </div>
                    <button type="button" onclick="sampleCode.createTemplate()">
                        Create and assign custom Template
                    </button>
                    <p>
                        Now we can change the template and the change will be reflected in the item. As we have assigned the attribute value as the label content, the label changes,
                        when the template that is connected to the attribute changes.
                    </p>
                    <div class="codediv">
                    <pre class="prettyprint" source="changeCustomTemplate"></pre>
                    </div>
                    <button type="button" onclick="sampleCode.changeCustomTemplate()">
                        Change custom Template
                    </button>
                    <p>
                        Templates can be used in a number of different situations to effectively predefine and reassign format or attribute information. There is also an option to load
                        predefined templates from XML files. Please visit the documentation for additional information about templates.
