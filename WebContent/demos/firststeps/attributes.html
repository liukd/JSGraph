					<h1>Working with Attributes</h1>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						Attributes can be used to influence the behavior and capabilities of a <code>GraphItem</code>. You can allow or deny editing capabilities like sizing, deleting or 
						moving. You can also change the behavior concerning selection and port assignment. Some of the attributes affect the visual appearance
						like clipping contained items or closing a polyline. Finally some of the attributes are related to the container functionality. In the following
						sections we will explain these in more detail. 
					</p>
					<h2>GraphItem Attributes changing the behavior</h2>
					<p>
						Sometimes it is desired to prohibit or deny capabilities of a <code>GraphItem</code>. Items are supposed to stay in place, keep their size or should not be rotated. These
						capabilities can be defined individually for each <code>GraphItem</code>. In the following sample, we will assign the attributes being related to the behavior. The label
						of the item visualizes the imposed restriction. Just try out to see, how the item reacts.  Some of the restrictions are directly visualized. E.g. an item that
						is not moveable does not show a move cursor or items that cannot be resized have grey selection handles.
					</p>
					<div class="codediv">
					<pre class="prettyprint" source="itemAttributesBehaviour"></pre>
					</div>
					<br/>
					<button type="button" onclick="sampleCode.itemAttributesBehaviour()">
						Set Behavior Attributes
					</button>
					<h2>GraphItem Attributes changing the visual appearance</h2>
					<p>
						Attributes that change the visual appearance can also be defined similar. You can close or open a polyline using an attribute. Only closed polyline can
						be filled with a color or a gradient. An item can be hidden using the visible attribute. You can also change the margins. Currently this only affects
						text nodes within a container.
					</p>
					<div class="codediv">
					<pre class="prettyprint" source="itemAttributesAppearance"></pre>
					</div>
					<br/>
					<button type="button" onclick="sampleCode.itemAttributesAppearance()">
						Set Appearance Attributes
					</button>
					<h2>GraphItem Attributes related to Container functionality</h2>
					<p>
						An item can contain other items. This feature is activated by default. If you move an item over another item it will be added automatically to 
						the container. This can be prohibits by setting the appropriate flag. Related to this functionality you can define, whether an item can be 
						collapsed and where the collapse/expand icon shall be displayed and how it collapses.
					</p>
					<div class="codediv">
					<pre class="prettyprint" source="itemAttributesContainer"></pre>
					</div>
					<br/>
					<button type="button" onclick="sampleCode.itemAttributesContainer()">
						Set Container Attributes
					</button>
					<p>
						Using containers you can create very complex graphs. Looking at our demo applications, you can observe that
						the swimlane and pool shape within the BPMN samples are created using containers. For an introduction, you did
						get an overview of the provided built in attributes. You can continue the tutorial with an introduction to
						custom attributes.
